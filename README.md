# Search for a Sterile Neutrino at the ILL Research Facility

The doctoral thesis focuses on the physics of reactor neutrinos. The increasingly precise study of antineutrinos spectra from reactors has revealed a deviation between the prediction and the measurements, which could indicate the existence of a new neutrino. This new neutrino state would not couple with the weak interaction (a sterile neutrino) and its mass would be around 1 eV/c². The STEREO experiment aims at testing the sterile neutrino hypothesis at the ILL reactor in Grenoble-France. The principle of the STEREO experiment is based on 6 identical detector cells aligned between 9 and 11.5 m distance from the core of the ILL research reactor. The detector started taking data in November 2016, and the first results were published in 2018. The work carried out during the thesis initially consisted in characterizing the detector's energy response. During the first phase of data taking, hardware failures occurred leading to the optical decoupling of a cell and a gradual increase in light cross-talk between cells. These two aspects have compelled data analysis to develop a dedicated energy deposit reconstruction algorithm that corrects first-order light leaks using a matrix formalism. Significant work on the measurement of the parameters of this method was undertaken to ensure that the energy scale was well reproduced in the GEANT4 simulation. The estimation of systematic uncertainties on the energy scale was performed using cosmogenic background events. The second major aspect addressed during the thesis is the statistical analysis and generation of exclusion contours of the sterile neutrino hypothesis. The statistical inference was built using the Feldman and Cousins (1999) method by generating frequentist confidence intervals. A formalization in χ² has been specially developed to conduct the oscillation analysis independently of any flux or shape prediction of the antineutrino spectra. Statistical and systematic errors were propagated using covariance matrices and χ² laws were constructed by generating pseudo-experiments. All the work carried out during this doctoral thesis contributed to the publication of three papers presenting the results of the STEREO experiment.
